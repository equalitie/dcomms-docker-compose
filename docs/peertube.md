# Peertube

## Gain access to admin account

By default the admin email is set to `changeme@example.com`. If you didn't change it when you [configured email](/conf/peertube/README.md#email) please do so now.

If you have done so, you can simply reset your password from the login page.

## Adding additional users

Peertube's options for this are limited. Invitations links are still being developed, and open registration is not recommended.  
Our suggested workflow is to create a user from the web admin interface, and instruct users to reset their password.
